Marking the Smartphone Class Assignment
Here is a breakdown of the marks for the Smartphone class assignment based on the provided rubric:
Object Design (20%): Excellent (4)
●
Comments: The object has six well-named attributes: brand, model, storageCapacity, ram, batteryCapacity, and screenSize. These are all appropriately typed using String, int, and double. The object also includes well-defined methods such as a constructor, getters and setters for each attribute, calculateBatteryLife, and displaySmartphoneDetails. The constructor and methods are properly documented with comments.
Encapsulation (20%): Excellent (4)
●
Comments: The assignment demonstrates excellent use of encapsulation. All attributes are declared as private, restricting direct access from outside the class. Access to these attributes is controlled through public getter and setter methods, ensuring data integrity and security.
Main Class Implementation (20%): Excellent (4)
●
Comments: The MainClass effectively uses control structures like the Scanner for input, if-else statements for decision making based on calculated battery life, and method calls to interact with the Smartphone object. The code is well-organized, readable, and free from errors. The implementation demonstrates strong programming skills in utilizing object-oriented principles.
Creativity and Object Choice (20%): Good (3)
●
Comments: While a smartphone is a relevant object to implement using OOP principles, it's a fairly common choice. The assignment would benefit from exploring slightly more unique or complex objects to showcase a deeper understanding of OOP. The attributes and methods are well-chosen and implemented, but could be expanded with more creative features.
○
Improvement: Consider choosing an object that presents more unique challenges for data representation or behaviour. For example, a smart home system with interconnected devices, a library catalog system, or a simulation of a biological ecosystem. These options would allow for more creative use of inheritance, polymorphism, and complex relationships between objects.
Documentation and Comments (10%): Excellent (4)
●
Comments: The code is well-documented with clear explanations for each attribute, method, and control structure. Comments are concise and effectively provide insights into the code's functionality.
Remarks: The assignment demonstrates a strong grasp of object-oriented programming concepts. The code is well-structured, readable, and functional. A slightly more creative object choice could further enhance the demonstration of OOP principles.
